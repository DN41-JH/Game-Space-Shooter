# Game-Space-Shooter

This is a game that allows a single player to control his/her own space ship that is able to emit laser bullet to attack randomly emerging enemy ships from the top of the game window. In order to win, the player needs to destroy all the enemy ships before any of them reaches to the bottom of the game window, while maintaining a non-zero health.
